<summary>VirtualBox Server 2016 Intial Setup</summary>
  
---  

This section outlines the configuration of VirtualBox to host a Windows Server 2016 virtual machine, which serves as the domain controller. The server is configured with role-based features, including Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), to simulate a fully functional domain environment. This setup provides a foundation for demonstrating user account management, group policy implementation, and other key administrative tasks.
