# Helpdesk Homelab

Welcome to my Helpdesk Homelab project! This setup demonstrates a simulated IT helpdesk environment using **VirtualBox**, **Windows Server 2019**, and **Active Directory**. It showcases core IT administrative skills, such as user account management, group policy configuration, and basic troubleshooting techniques, all designed to replicate real-world scenarios.

## üåê Active Directory Domain Services

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is a critical role for managing user identities, groups, and resources in a centralized domain. To install AD DS on Windows Server 2019, I used the Server Manager to add the role, configured it as the primary domain controller, and set up the domain goodcorp.com. This step establishes the foundation for centralized management and security in the lab environment.
